  <h1>Types of Classes</h1>

  <div class="class-descriptions">
    <div class="class-item">
      <h2>Yoga</h2>
      <p>Yoga classes are fantastic for both your body and mind. In a basic yoga session, an instructor guides you through various stretches and poses while emphasizing breath control and mindfulness. Common yoga poses include downward-facing dog, upward-facing dog, tree pose, mountain pose, and warrior poses. Whether you're a beginner or more experienced, yoga offers improved muscle tone, flexibility, and stress reduction.</p>

      <h2>Spin (Indoor Cycling)</h2>
      <p>Spin classes involve a group of people pedaling stationary bikes together under the guidance of an instructor. These classes start with a warm-up and gradually increase intensity. You'll pedal at different speeds and resistance levels, sometimes even "hovering" over the bike. It's a high-energy cardio workout that gets your heart pumping and legs burning.</p>
    </div>
